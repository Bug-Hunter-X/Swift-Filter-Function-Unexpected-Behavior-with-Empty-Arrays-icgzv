This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Swift's `filter` function when dealing with empty arrays. The issue arises when the filter condition is such that no elements satisfy it, even though the initial array isn't empty.  The expected behavior is to return an empty array, but certain conditions can lead to unexpected or erroneous results.  The `bug.swift` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.swift` shows the corrected approach.
